                          Decentralized Finance Lending and Borrowing Platform
  
  This project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform alowes users securely deposit, withdraw, and manage collateral through smart contracts. 
  One of its key features is a time-lock, which ensures funds cannot be withdrawn until a set period has passed, providing added security. 
  The platform also allows users to add or remove collateral, with all actions being tracked by events that log deposits, withdrawals, and collateral updates. 
  By using SafeMath, the system ensures safe and reliable calculations, minimizing risks. 
  Ultimately, this project aims to give users a transparent and trustless way to manage their funds and assets, free from traditional intermediaries.
